							        			<p>
							        				Palliative care takes a holistic approach to each individual with the aim of relieving the symptoms of disease. Patients can avail of palliative care at any age, and at any stage in a serious illness. The disease may be curable or life-threatening.
							        			</p>
							        		<h3>WHAT IS PALLIATIVE CARE?</h3>
											<p>The World Health Organisation defines Palliative care as:

                                           “…an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing problems associated with life-threatening illnesses, through the prevention and relief of suffering. Palliative care focuses on the treatment of pain and other problems, integrating the physical, psychosocial and spiritual needs of care. Palliative care offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible and also offers a support system to help the family cope during the patient’s illness”
											</p>
											<h3> Supporting the family</h3>
											<p>Our palliative care team at Comfort Keepers makes support of the family as well as the patient a priority.

                                          As well as the patient’s own battle with illness, the burden on their families is also a key concern for the team. The needs and concerns of the family change as the illness of a loved one improves or progresses. Guidance of caregiving may also be required.

							        			<p>
							        				The terms ‘dementia’ and ‘Alzheimer’s’ are sometimes used interchangeably. However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. This can sometimes cause confusion for patients, families and carers.
													</p>
							        			<h3>WHAT IS DEMENTIA?</h3>
												<p>Dementia is a broad term which refers to a range of symptoms of declining mental functioning brought on by degenerative brain disease. These symptoms might include a deterioration in memory, intellect, judgement and social skills. This can impact on the person’s ability to carry out everyday tasks and may cause mood and personality changes (HSE.ie).

                                                While there is no cure for dementia, some medications may help to slow the progress of the disease.
												</p>
												<h3>DEMENTIA IN IRELAND</h3>
												<p>There are over 44,000 people living with dementia in Ireland and over 50,000 dementia carers. As our aging population continues to grow, so too will the numbers living with dementia. It is projected that by 2036, there will be over 100,000 people living with dementia in Ireland.

                                                 The need for excellent in-home dementia care and support for patients’ families is becoming more and more pronounced.
												</p>
												<h3>DEMENTIA CARE</h3>
												<p>In our experience, older people are happier when they can remain living in their own homes independently for as long as possible. This is especially true for those living with dementia.

                                                  Evidence suggests that by remaining engaged and active, a person with dementia can maintain their skills and independence for longer.

                                                     When it comes to carrying out daily tasks, dependence on others will gradually increase.  How quickly this happens depends on the individual, but more support and care will be needed as time goes on.

                                                   This is where Comfort Keepers carers can provide the support and assistance required in the home to the family and their loved one. Our experienced Client Care Managers will develop a tailored care plan based on the family’s needs which is implemented by experienced carers.
